# Face-Emotion-Detection-
Overview
This project aims to detect emotions from facial expressions using computer vision and deep learning. The model identifies key emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral expressions from face images or video streams. Emotion detection can be useful in applications like customer feedback analysis, mood-based recommendations, mental health monitoring, and interactive AI systems.
Features
Detects multiple emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fear, and Neutral
Real-time emotion detection in videos or live camera feed
Pretrained model available, with option to retrain on custom datasets
User-friendly interface to visualize detected emotions on images or video
High accuracy due to advanced face and emotion detection techniques
Dataset
This project uses the FER-2013 Dataset as the primary training data, a widely used dataset containing labeled images for various emotions. For training on additional datasets, the data should be structured with folders for each emotion (e.g., happy/, sad/, etc.).

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-emotion-detection.git
cd face-emotion-detection
Install Dependencies: Use the requirements.txt file to install dependencies.

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Pretrained Model: Download the pretrained model weights from here and place it in the models/ directory.

Usage
1. Running Emotion Detection on Images
Run the following command to detect emotions in an image:

bash

python detect_emotion.py --image path/to/image.jpg
2. Real-Time Emotion Detection with Webcam
Run the following command to start real-time emotion detection with your webcam:

bash
Copy code
python detect_emotion.py --realtime
3. Training the Model (Optional)
To train the model on a custom dataset:

bash

python train_model.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 20
Model Architecture
The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction from face images, followed by a dense layer to classify the emotion. The architecture is designed for fast inference and real-time applications.

Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of 79% on the FER-2013 test set. You can evaluate the model using:

bash

python evaluate_model.py --dataset path/to/test-dataset
